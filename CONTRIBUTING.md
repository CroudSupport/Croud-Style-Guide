## How to Contribute

Hey! It's great that you want to share with the rest of us!

At this very early stage, we need to gain some traction so don't be afraid to add some new reuseable components. However, as with most things, there are a few rules that we would like you to follow.

***Boooooooo!***

### Technical Documentation

Please ensure any new components added to the technical documentation comply with the following rules:

* At least one example of the new component must be visible
* All component props must have a basic description
